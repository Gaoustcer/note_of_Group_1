## Question 1: Heap Sort

assume the heap is Max heap

### When a[1]<a[2]<a[3]<....<a[n]

Build the heap:from n/2 to n assume n=$2^k$,k=$log_2(n)$

Then the Tree has k+1 layers. We will have to exchange the elements for$1+2+3+...+k$ times to build the initial Max-heap.

Generally, we will need to exchange for$$\Theta({log_2(n)}^2)$$ times to build the initial Heap.

Then we have to maintain the Max-heap.

final result is $\Theta$(n$\times$$log_2(n)$)

### When a[1]>a[2]>a[3]>...>a[n]

It is already a MAX-heap,so it takes no time to build the MAX-heap

Then it will take O(n$log_2(n)$)to maintain the Max_heap



## Question2:quick sort

### (a)

assume the H is the max-height of the Tree and h is the minimize height of the Tree.

We have following relationships:

$${1\div \alpha}^h=n$$

$$a\div (1-\alpha)^H=n$$

The result is $$h=-lgn\div lg\alpha$$

$$   H=-lgn\div lg(1-\alpha)$$

### (b)

假设产生两个不同的1划分$$\alpha,1-\alpha$$和$$\theta,1-\theta$$的概率相同

那么比$$\alpha,1-\alpha$$更好的划分必须更加接近中心1/2

概率为$$(1\div 2-\alpha)\div(1\div 2)=(1-2\times\alpha)$$
